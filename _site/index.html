<h2>What Are Trusses?</h2>
<p>A type of structure commonly used in engineering is a frame, which is
a supporting structure with multiple beams. The sides are called
members, which are connected to each other by pins. A pin is a specific
type of connector that allows the members it attaches to spin around but
keeps the end touching the pin from moving vertically or
horizontally.</p>

<p>Trusses are a special type of frame that exclusively consists of
members connected with pin supports with only two forces acting on each
individual member (commonly called two-force members). They are an
excellent option for distributing forces and making a structure more
stable. Trusses are very commonly used in construction and civil
engineering, but most people know about them from truss bridges.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Truss frames will have a pin at the vertex between
two or more members, while non-truss frames may have a pin connector in
the middle of a member</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>A truss bridge is a bridge made up of these truss frames, typically
either wood or metal. Truss bridges are especially stable because the
truss frames are triangular, which cannot be distorted by stress. We
will be focusing on the Waddell A Truss bridge, which was designed and
patented by J.A.L. Waddell in 1894. This truss bridge is unique because
it is specifically for short spans and takes the shape of an A
frame.</p>
<div id="the-waddell-truss" class="section level3">
<h3>The Waddell Truss</h3>
<p>Waddell conceived this bridge design while he was serving as a
visiting professor at Tokyo University in 1880. During his time there,
he observed the many British-engineered short-span railway bridges, and
felt he could improve their design. He criticized the use of pony
trusses, which are trusses that only span the sides of the bridge and do
not connect overhead. These types of trusses are vulnerable to winds and
heavy loads. Inspired by A-frame roofs, Waddell designed the A-frame
truss bridge, which he claimed superior due to them having “great
rigidity in all directions, ease and cheapness of erection, and economy
of metal when it is compared with structures of other types having equal
strength and rigidity”. He also commented that “its appearance is odd
but not displeasing”.</p>
<p>The Waddell A truss bridge design was popular for a short time in the
early 20th century United States, but fell out of fashion as the Pratt
truss bridge design quickly became the norm, as it can span much greater
distances. Currently, there are only two surviving Waddell A truss
bridges, one in Parkville, Missouri and one in Shreveport, Louisiana.
Both of these were relocated from their original build sites to these
locations.</p>

<div id="trusses-and-force-balance" class="section level3">
<h3>Trusses and Force Balance</h3>
<p>In structural engineering, the function of a truss is to hold up a
load, which exerts a force on the truss. A load can be any force applied
to the truss, such as a car going over a bridge or a porch swing hanging
from the ceiling. You can think of forces as vector quantities, which
have a magnitude (length) and direction which can be defined in terms of
positive and negative quantities of x and y. At its simplest, the force
of a load is just its weight and acts only in the negative y, or
downward, direction.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/image3.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Waddell A Truss labeled with pins</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>Traditionally, pins are noted by capital letters and members are
named by the two pins at the ends. For example, the vertical member in
the middle is CG because it has pin G at the top and pin C at the
bottom. Additionally, it is very common to simplify trusses into two
dimensions, x and y. Like in the Euclidean plane, the positive y
direction is up and the positive x direction is to the right. For
example, a person standing above pin C on the bridge might exert a -600
N force in the y direction. Similarly, a bunch of helium balloons at the
same point might exert a force of +2 N in the y direction.</p>
<p>Since trusses are designed to hold up large loads on bridges or
roofs, we don’t want them to move. Mathematically, that means all the
forces acting on each member and pin need to balance each other out so
that the net force on any member or pin is zero. This concept, called
force balance, is pretty intuitive when broken down. For example, say
you and your friend are pushing the same table in opposite directions.
If you are both pushing at the same magnitude, but in opposite
directions, the table will not move. But if you push harder than them,
the table will move towards them. Here, we will be representing forces
as vectors in which the magnitude is the force and the direction is the
direction in which the force is acting.</p>
<p>If we know the force acting on the truss we can figure out how much
of that force is acting on each part of the truss using force
balances.</p>
<p>The way the members of a truss react to an applied load is best
explained by something like the figure below. Imagine you have a straw
held at an angle, and you pull one end left and the other right. The
straw will turn until it’s parallel to the directions you’re pulling
it.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/image4.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Load applied to a straw</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>The same concept applies to the members of a truss. Each member is
either in compression (being squished) or tension (being pulled). Since
the net force must be zero, each member has to be pulled or pushed
amount and opposite directions from both ends.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-to-solve-a-force-balance" class="section level2">
<h2>How To Solve a Force Balance</h2>
<p>Say we want to know the force acting on all members of the truss when
there is a person standing on pin C exerting a force of 600 N in the
negative y direction. We can set up equations for pins and members until
we have as many equations as we have unknown variables – that is what we
need in order for it to be mathematically solvable.</p>
<p>Our first step is to make sure the forces on the whole truss are
balanced. For our bridge to not sink into the ground when a person is
standing on it, the ground has to push up as much as the person’s weight
pushes down. Given that each end of the truss bridge is resting on the
ground for support and the person is standing in the middle, the upward
force acting each of the supports is half of our assigned load.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/image5.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Load and support on the Waddell A Truss</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>The distribution of a force throughout the truss can be modeled by
the force acting on the pins. We make an “assumption” that all members
are in either tension or compression, making each pin either have all
forces pulling or all forces pushing on it. If a member we assumed was
in tension when it was actually in compression, the force it exerts on
the pins will come out negative.</p>
<p>One way we simplified our diagram is to assume that all members of
the truss are in tension. If member CG, for example, is in tension, then
it will be effectively “pulling” pins C and G towards each other. As a
result, we draw all member forces pulling away from the pins. The
applied force and support forces we draw in the directions we know they
are pulling, so the load points straight down and the support forces
point straight up.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/image6.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Complete force diagram of the Waddell A Truss</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>Notice how in member CH, pin C and pin H both have Force CH pulling
on them.</p>
<p>To find the force on each pin, we break it down into the total force
in both the x and y directions. Think of this like breaking down each
force into multiples of the basis vectors <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{e_1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{e_2}\)</span>. The total force on each pin,
in each direction, must equal to zero.</p>
<p>For example, the force of member AH pulls pin A both up and to the
right, creating the force <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F_{AH}}\)</span>. We call the upward part of
the force the y-component and the rightward part of the force the
x-component. We can use the geometry of the truss to help us find the
exact amount of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F_{AH}}\)</span> acting
along each direction.</p>
<p>To solve for each specific force on a pin, you can set up a system of
linear equations. Given that all the triangular sections of the truss
are right-angled isosceles triangles, the diagonal angel is <span
class="math inline">\(45^\circ\)</span>. All diagonal components of the
forces are either <span class="math inline">\(sin(45^\circ)\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(cos(45^\circ)\)</span>, which are both <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Pin A:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma \vec{F_{X}} = \vec{F_{AB}} +
(\vec{F_{AH}}\cdot cos(\theta)) = \vec{F_{AB}} +
(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\cdot \vec{F_{AH}}) = 0\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma \vec{F_{Y}} = 300 +
(\vec{F_{AH}}\cdot sin(\theta)) = (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot
\vec{F_{AH}}) = -300\)</span></p>
<p>We repeat this process for every pin, which will result in two linear
equations for each pin in the truss. The load and support forces, which
are known, are the outputs of the linear equations for the pins on which
they are acting. All other equations will equal zero. While we could
solve them all by hand, that is a very time-consuming process. It is
much easier to solve them using linear algebra.</p>

<p>Each column contains all zeros except for exactly one 1 along the
main diagonal, called the pivot. The value on the right hand side of the
pivot row is the value of the force. For example, <span
class="math inline">\(F_{AB}\)</span> is the first column, which has a
pivot in the first row. The value on the right hand side of the first
row is 300. That is, <span class="math inline">\(F_{AB} = 300\)</span>,
so member AB is experiencing 300 N of tension. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(F_{AH} = -424\)</span>, meaning that member AH is
experiencing 424 N of compression. The forces which are equal to 0, such
as <span class="math inline">\(F_{DF}\)</span>, are what we call
zero-force members. They don’t have any forces acting on them when the
load is placed at point C.</p>
<p>Notice how the bottom 3 rows of the RREF matrix are empty. That is
because we had more equations than variables. We could have used 3 fewer
equations and still gotten values for every force!</p>
<p>Now you know the forces acting on each member. This is important in
engineering because we need to know the distribution of force on the
truss as a whole and the maximum load (and what member that load is
acting on). This will help in choosing materials of correct strength and
size.</p>
