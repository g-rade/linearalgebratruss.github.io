<h2>What Are Trusses?</h2>
<p>A type of structure commonly used in engineering is a frame, which is
a supporting structure with multiple beams. The sides are called
members, which are connected to each other by pins. A pin is a specific
type of connector that allows the members it attaches to spin around but
keeps the end touching the pin from moving vertically or
horizontally.</p>
<p><img src="images/image1.png" /></p>
<p>Trusses are a special type of frame that exclusively consists of
members connected with pin supports with only two forces acting on each
individual member (commonly called two-force members). They are an
excellent option for distributing forces and making a structure more
stable. Trusses are very commonly used in construction and civil
engineering, but most people know about them from truss bridges.</p>
<p><img src="images/image2.png" /></p>
<p>A truss bridge is a bridge made up of these truss frames, typically
either wood or metal. Truss bridges are especially stable because the
truss frames are triangular, which cannot be distorted by stress. We
will be focusing on the Waddell A Truss bridge, which was designed and
patented by J.A.L. Waddell in 1894. This truss bridge is unique because
it is specifically for short spans and takes the shape of an A
frame.</p>

<h3>The Waddell Truss</h3>
<p>Waddell conceived this bridge design while he was serving as a
visiting professor at Tokyo University in 1880. During his time there,
he observed the primarily British-engineered short-span railway bridges,
and felt he could improve their design. He criticized the use of pony
trusses, which are trusses that only span the sides of the bridge and do
not connect overhead. These types of trusses are vulnerable to winds and
heavy loads. Inspired by A-frame roofs, Waddell designed the A-frame
truss bridge, which he claimed superior due to having “great rigidity in
all directions, ease and cheapness of erection, and economy of metal
when it is compared with structures of other types having equal strength
and rigidity”. He also commented that “Its appearance is odd but not
displeasing”.</p>
<p>The Waddell A truss bridge design was popular for a short time in the
early 20th century United States, but quickly fell out of fashion as the
Pratt truss bridge design quickly became the norm, as it can span much
greater distances. Currently, there are only two surviving Waddell A
truss bridges, one in Parkville, Missouri and one in Shreveport,
Louisiana. Both of these were relocated from their original build sites
to these locations.</p>

<h3>Trusses and Force Balance</h3>
<p>In structural engineering, the function of a truss is to hold up a
load, which exerts a force on the truss. A load can be any force applied
to the truss, such as a car going over a bridge or a porch swing hanging
from the rafters above a porch. You can think of forces as vector
quantities, which have a magnitude (length) and direction which can be
defined in terms of positive and negative quantities of x and y. At its
simplest, the force of a load is just its weight and acts only in the
negative y, or downward, direction.</p>
<p><img src="images/image3.png" /></p>
<p>Traditionally, pins are noted by capital letters and members are
named by the two pins at the ends. For example, the vertical member in
the middle is GC because it has pin G at the top and pin C at the
bottom. Additionally, it is very common to simplify trusses into two
dimensions, x and y. Like in the Euclidean plane, the positive y
direction is up and the positive x direction is to the right. For
example, a person standing above pin C on the bridge might exert a ~ 600
N force in the y direction. Similarly, a bunch of helium balloons at the
same point might exert a force of + 2 N in the y direction.</p>
<p>Since trusses are designed to hold up large loads on bridges or
roofs, we don’t want them to move. Mathematically, that means all the
forces acting on each member and pin need to balance each other out so
that the net force on any member or pin is zero. This concept, called
force balance, is pretty intuitive when broken down. For example, say
you and your friend are pushing the same table in opposite directions.
If you are pushing as hard on the table as your friend is, the table
will not move, but if you push harder than them, the table will move
towards them. Here, we will be representing forces as vectors in which
the magnitude is the force and the direction is the direction in which
the force is acting.</p>
<p>Using force balances, if we know the force acting on the truss we can
figure out how much of that force is acting on each part of the
truss.</p>
<p>The way the members of a truss react to an applied load is best
explained by something like the figure below. Imagine you have a straw
held at an angle, and you pull one end left and the other right. The
straw will turn until it’s parallel to the directions you’re pulling
it.</p>
<p><img src="images/image4.png" /></p>
<p>The same concept applies to the members of a truss. Each member is
either in compression (being squished) or tension (being pulled). Since
the net force must be zero, each member has to be pulled or pushed
amount and opposite directions from both ends.</p>
</div>

<div id="how-to-solve-a-force-balance" class="section level2">
<h2>How To Solve a Force Balance</h2>
<p>Say we want to know the force acting on all members of the truss when
there is a person standing on pin C exerting a force of 600 N in the
negative y direction. We can set up equations for pins and members until
we have as many equations as we have unknown variables – that is what we
need in order for it to be mathematically solvable.</p>
<p>Our first step is to make sure the forces on the whole truss are
balanced. For our bridge to not sink into the ground when a person is
standing on it, the ground has to push up as much as the person’s weight
pushes down. Given that each end of the truss bridge is resting on the
ground for support and the person is standing in the middle, the upward
force acting each of the supports is half of our assigned load.</p>
<p><img src="images/image5.png" /></p>
<p>The distribution of a force throughout the truss can be modeled by
the force acting on the pins. We make an “assumption” that all members
are in either tension or compression, making each pin either have all
forces pulling or all forces pushing on it. If a member we assumed was
in tension when it was actually in compression, the force it exerts on
the pins will come out negative.</p>
<p>One way we simplified our diagram is to assume that all members of
the truss are in tension. If member CG, for example, is in tension, then
it will be effectively “pulling” pins C and G towards each other. As a
result, we draw all member forces pulling away from the pins. The
applied force and support forces we draw in the directions we know they
are pulling, so the load points straight down and the support forces
point straight up.</p>
<p><img src="images/image6.png" /></p>
<p>Notice how in member CH, pin C and pin H both have Force CH pulling
on them.<br />
To find the force on each pin, we break it down into the total force in
both the x and y directions. Think of this like breaking down each force
into multiples of the basis vectors e1 and e2. The total force on each
pin, in each direction, must equal to zero.</p>
<p>For example, the force of member AH pulls pin A both up and to the
right, creating the force FAH. We call the upward part of the force the
y-component and the rightward part of the force the x-component. We can
use the geometry of the truss to help us find the exact amount of FAH
acting along each direction.</p>
<p>[equation]</p>
<p>To solve for each specific force on a pin, you can set up a system of
linear equations.</p>
<p>[equations]</p>
<p>We repeat this process for every pin, which will result in two linear
equations for each pin in the truss. The load and support forces, which
are known, are the outputs of the linear equations for the pins on which
they are acting. All other equations will equal zero. While we could
solve them all by hand, that is a very time-consuming process. It is
much easier to solve them using linear algebra.</p>
<p>We can put all the force balance equations for the pin supports into
an augmented matrix.</p>
<p>[matrix]</p>
<p>The columns of the matrix correspond to each member of the truss and
the rows alternate between the x and y directions. Additionally, each
column in the augmented matrix should sum to zero. We can simplify the
matrix by using software to put it in row-reduced echelon form.</p>
<p>[matrix]</p>
<p>Each column contains all zeros except for exactly one 1 along the
main diagonal, called the pivot. The value on the right hand side of the
pivot row is the value of the force. For example, FAB is the first
column, which has a pivot in the first row. The value on the right hand
side of the first row is 300. That is, <span class="math inline">\(F_AB
= 300\)</span>, so member AB is experiencing 300 N of tension.
Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(F_AH = -424\)</span>, meaning
that member AH is experiencing 424 N of compression. The forces which
are equal to 0, such as FDF, are what we call zero-force members. They
don’t have any forces acting on them when the load is placed at point
C.</p>
<p>Notice how the bottom 3 rows of the RREF matrix are empty. That is
because we had more equations than variables. We could have used 3 fewer
equations and still gotten values for every force!</p>
